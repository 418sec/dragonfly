Dragonfly Documentation
=======================
Dragonfly is a {http://rack.rubyforge.org Rack} framework for on-the-fly image handling in Ruby.

It is suitable for using with web frameworks such as Rails, Sinatra, etc.

I actually lied about image handling - it can be used for any type of content.

See the links on the right for more info.
