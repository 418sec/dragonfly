Dragonfly Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the documentation for Dragonfly!

Dragonfly is a {http://rack.rubyforge.org Rack} framework for on-the-fly processing and encoding.

It includes an extension for Ruby on Rails to enable easy image handling.
It is intended to be highly customizable, and is not limited to images, but any data type that could suit on-the-fly processing/encoding.

Use the dropdowns at the top-right to navigate around the code, or jump straight to one of the guides on the right.
